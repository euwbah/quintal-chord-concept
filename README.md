# Quintal Chord Concept

> a tool for visualising the process of musical chord construction

### Abstract (WIP)

Since Pythagoreas, the fifth has been established as a stable musical interval.
Being the second most consonant interval apart from the octave, it is not unlikely
for the psychoacoustical octave equivalence phenomenon to carry over to fifths as well.

The Quintal Chord Concept extrapolates upon this construct to suggest that, to a certain extent,
stacked fifths can represent variations in texture in the same manner stacked octaves do,
and thus utilising this hypothesis to provide a fresh perspective on how stacked fifths
in chords can represent different 'levels' of the same 'color' in the same way
octaves represent different 'levels' of the same 'note'.
